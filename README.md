# parkinsonMetaAnalysis
A package for the meta-analysis of shotgun datasets

# 2025-02-21

This repository will contain meta-analysis contents and concepts 
for publicly available shotgun metagenomics datasets. Part of the 
difficulty in gathering all is that metadata is almost always 
omitted, making incomplete datasets virtually useless.
